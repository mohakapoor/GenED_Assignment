"""
STARTER FILE — build the actual service here (or restructure into more
files/modules if you prefer; this single-file skeleton is just a starting
point, not a requirement).

See PROBLEM.md for the full spec. Summary of what needs to exist by the end:

  POST /students/{student_id}/attempts
      Body: {"skill_id": str, "is_correct": bool}
      - Only the student themselves may submit their own attempts.
      - Updates that student's mastery score (0-100) for that skill using a
        scoring approach YOU design and justify in WRITEUP.md.
      - Calls get_ai_feedback() (see ai_feedback.py) to get a feedback
        string for the response. That call is slow and sometimes fails —
        your endpoint must still behave well when it does.
      - Enforces: max 30 attempts per student per rolling 24h. A request
        that fails validation (bad skill_id, malformed body, etc.) must NOT
        count against that limit.
      - If this attempt takes the student's mastery for that skill above 80
        for the first time, a milestone notification must be durably
        recorded — including surviving a crash between "mastery updated"
        and "notification recorded."

  GET /students/{student_id}/mastery
      - A student may view their own mastery.
      - A teacher may view mastery for any student on their own roster
        (see seed_data.TEACHER_ROSTERS), and no one else's.
      - Returns current mastery per skill for that student.

  GET /notifications/{student_id}
      - Same access rule as above. Returns the milestone notifications
        recorded for that student.

Everything below this docstring is scaffolding, not a solution — feel free
to delete, restructure, or heavily rewrite it.
